# 📱 Kitchen Utensils 

This Flutter app is a **Kitchen Utensils Identification System** designed to help users recognize various kitchen tools using image classification technology. The application uses **Teachable Machine models** to identify utensils through image scanning and provide relevant information such as:

- Utensil name  
- Accuracy percentage  
- Possible similar items  
- Related recipes  

The main goal of this project is to assist users, beginners, students, and culinary learners in identifying kitchen utensils accurately and quickly, especially when they are unfamiliar with certain tools. This can help in **cooking, learning, organizing, and understanding different utensils used in the kitchen**.

The app consists of **six main screens**:  
🏠 Home • 🕒 History • 🔍 Scanner • 📚 Collection • 📊 Analytics  • 🍲 Recipe Collection
